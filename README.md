## Binary Tree

- **Binary Tree:** Each node can have 0, 1 or 2 nodes.

- **Perfect Binary tree(efficient):** a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.

  **Properties:**

      - The number of nodes doubles at each level.
      - Number of nodes in the last level = (Number of nodes in the previous levels + 1).
      - Total number of nodes: 2 <sup>h</sup> -1, where h = height of binary tree.

- **Full Binary Tree:** a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.
